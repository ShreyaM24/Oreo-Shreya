 <h1> DEVELOPER'S STORY</h1>
 <p>The developer goes by the name Shreya Manak and her love for Oreos has been visible since her elementry school days. She loves to eat as many Oreos as possible. Once she finished two sixteen pack Oreos within one day! She feels that eating Oreos is a stress-reliever that she would love to do over and over again. Her love for Oreos became visible when she did her third grade poem project on Oreos. For the majority of her birthdays she chose to buy an Oreo flavored cake.
